Design and color scheme

Color PaletteThe website’s colour palette is inspired directly by the natural beauty of Sardinia and the traditional decorations on the family’s fishing boat. Prussian Blue (#01243F) was chosen to represent the deep, rich tones of the Sardinian sea, reflecting depth, trust, and professionalism. Verdigris (#02AB93) captures the vibrant turquoise shades often seen in shallow coastal waters, giving the design a fresh and inviting feel. Cool Horizon (#78A7D0) mirrors the softer blues of the sky and distant sea, adding calmness and balance to the palette. To complement these cool tones, Night Bordeaux (#550C15) was selected from the red detailing on the boat’s painted trim, introducing warmth, contrast, and a touch of local character. Together, these colours create a harmonious, authentic scheme that ties the website visually to Sardinia’s maritime identity and the family’s fishing heritage.

Wireframes
The wireframes were created using Figma. I developed low-fidelity wireframes to map out the structure of each page, including the hero section, tour information panels, timetable layout, itinerary, and contact section. These wireframes focused on spacing, hierarchy, and navigation flow rather than colour or imagery.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – Provides semantic structure to improve accessibility, readability, and search engine optimisation.
CSS3 – Used to create custom styling, animations, and a fully responsive layout across devices.
Bootstrap 5 – Applied for its grid system, responsive utilities, forms, and pre-built components to streamline development.
Google Fonts – Syne and Urbanist were chosen to deliver a clean, modern, and visually strong typographic style.
CSS Variables – Implemented for consistent theming, easier maintenance, and efficient global colour and style control.

Implementation Notes
The website was developed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and mobile responsiveness. HTML5 semantic elements were used to structure the content logically, making the site more accessible and easier for search engines to index. Bootstrap 5’s grid and utility classes ensured consistent spacing and layout behaviour across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, reducing the need for complex custom CSS.
CSS variables were implemented for colour management, allowing the Sardinia-inspired palette to be applied consistently throughout the site and making future adjustments easier. Components such as navigation, cards, and buttons were customised lightly to match the project’s visual identity while keeping the code maintainable. All media elements, including video and imagery, were optimised for fast loading without compromising quality.
Form validation and basic interactivity rely on built-in Bootstrap and HTML features to keep the user experience smooth and lightweight. The design and layout decisions were guided by the Figma wireframes, ensuring the final implementation aligns closely with the planned structure.

SEO Implementation
A full set of SEO practices was applied to ensure the website is discoverable, accessible, and easily ranked by search engines. All pages include well-structured HTML5 semantic tags, descriptive <title> elements, and clear meta descriptions. Relevant keywords related to Sardinia, fishing tours, and coastal activities were naturally integrated into the content.
Images were optimised with descriptive alt attributes, helping both accessibility and search indexing. Clean URLs, proper heading hierarchy (H1–H3), and fast-loading media contribute to improved performance scores. The site also includes a mobile-friendly layout, which is essential for SEO ranking.
Open Graph tags were added to enhance link previews when shared on social platforms, and a sitemap was generated to help search engines crawl the website efficiently. These combined techniques ensure the website is well-optimised and ready for strong visibility online.

Manual Testing
All internal navigation links were tested and function correctly across different devices and screen sizes.
The quote form includes built-in HTML5 validation, preventing submission when required fields are left empty.
The responsive layout was verified on mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1440px+) screens to ensure consistent behaviour.
Typography, spacing, and layout were checked for consistency across major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
All interactive elements—such as buttons, forms, and inputs—were tested for full keyboard accessibility.
Every image was inspected to confirm meaningful and descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.

Validation
HTML Validation: All pages were validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. No critical issues were detected; minor warnings are intentional due to form structure without server-side processing.
CSS Validation: Stylesheets successfully passed validation through the W3C CSS Validation Service, including the use of valid CSS custom properties.
Google PageSpeed Insights: Performance checks were carried out using Chrome DevTools (desktop view), confirming optimised loading and responsiveness.
